# IMU10DOF_STM32F407
This project demonstrates how to interface an STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller with an IMU10DOF sensor (which includes an accelerometer and gyroscope) via the I2C communication protocol. The project reads the accelerometer and gyroscope values and prints them to a serial terminal for monitoring.
